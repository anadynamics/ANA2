# Area of contributions

The first and best way to contribute to chemfiles is to use it and advertise it
to other potential users. Other than that, you can help with:

- the documentation: correcting typos, improving the sentences to make things
  more clear;
- bug fixes and improvement to existing C++ code;
- implementing new formats;
- improving the C interface;
- and many more â€¦

All these contributions are very welcome. We accept contributions either via
Github pull request (have a look [here][PR] for Github model of pull request);
or you can send patches by email at luthaf@luthaf.fr.

If you want to work on the code and pick something easy to get started, have a
look at the [easy level issues][L-Easy].


# Bug reports and feature requests

Bug and feature requests should be reported as [Github issue][issue]. For bugs,
you should provide information so that we can reproduce it: what did you try?
What did you expect? What happened instead? Please provide any useful code
snippet or input file with your bug report.

If you want to add a new feature to chemfiles, please create an [issue] so that
we can discuss it, and you have more chances to see your changes incorporated.

anything is unclear, please [ask][Gitter] for clarifications! There are no dumb
questions.

---

Start by [forking chemfiles][fork], and then clone and build your fork locally
by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/chemfiles
cd chemfiles
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then create a new branch for your changes

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

Do your changes, containing the documentation (in `doc`) and associated unit
tests (in `tests`) for new code.

Then, run all the test and check that they still pass:

```bash
cmake -DCHFL_BUILD_TESTS=ON .
make
ctest
```

Finally, you can push your code to Github, and create a [Pull-Request][PR] to
the `chemfiles/chemfiles` repository.

```bash
git commit  # ask for help if you don't know how to use git
git push -u origin <new-branch>
```
