# External libraries used in chemfiles

This directory contains external libraries used in chemfiles. Each of these
library is distributed under it's own license, which are all included in the
archive and reproduced at the end of this file.

## Updating

We maintain a set of patches to these libraries, in there respective forks, in
the `chemfiles` branch.

- fmt: https://github.com/chemfiles/fmt
- toml11: https://github.com/chemfiles/toml11
- molfiles: https://github.com/chemfiles/molfiles
- TNG: https://github.com/chemfiles/tng
- NetCDF: https://github.com/chemfiles/netcdf-c

To update a library, update the corresponding repository, and then regenerate
the archive to be included in this directory with

```bash
# <lib> is the library name: tng, molfiles, netcdf, ...
git archive HEAD -9 --prefix=<lib>/ -o <lib>.tar.gz
```
